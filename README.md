![The solution Banner](./images/header.png)

## Introduction

This proof-of-concept has beed developed for global tank manufacturing and inspection company. The solution aims to revolutionize the manufacturing, repair & maintenance(R&M) and inspection process by leveraging microsoft Fabric.

The state-of-the-art cloud data platform is intricately designed to seamlessly ingest data, process and empower advanced analytics thereby driving operational excellence.

The data platform offers a comprehensive view across **ingeation, processing, and consumption** stages, while also addressing data governance aspects such as **data security, data quality, and data lineage ertc.**

- **Custoemr 360 Dashboard**: A real-time dashboard to get a customer 360 view to increase topline growth
- **GenAI Assistant**: Users can ask questions, and the GenAI assistant responds with relevant information extracted from the uploaded knowledge base.

## Git Repository Structure

- `app`: This folder provides main GenAI Assistant application containing the Streamlit UI and backend logic.
- `app/knowlede-base`: This folder contains tank inspection related knowledge artefacts.
- `data`: Sample data used for data ingestion and processing (Custeomr, Tank, Design and Inspection)
- `inspection_report`: Sample inspection reports generated by field engineer at site
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the solution.

## Gen-AI Assistant

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7+
